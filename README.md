# sudoku-solver

~~older project. proof of concept. got bored (neither sufficiently novel nor difficult).~~

This so-called "Sudoku Solver" project is a very old project I revisited while initially trying to repurpose the UI.

I ultimately decided to not reuse the UI (partly due to concerns with Tkinter), rewrote/refactored virtually everything, and added many expected (i.e. typical) features along the way.

Although I do not actually play much Sudoku, I thoroughly enjoy building things!

I have not yet employed DLX (Algorithm X; or dancing links), so the performance suffers accordingly. :(

The application currently contains most of the functionality you would find in a typical Sudoku application, despite the title remaining unchanged.
