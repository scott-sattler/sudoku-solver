# sudoku-solver

~~older project. proof of concept. got bored (neither sufficiently novel nor difficult).~~

Very old project I got sucked into while trying to reuse the UI for a friend. I eneded up rewriting most of it, and adding a lot of features. I really like building things (though do need to be mindful with time allocation!

I have not yet employed DLX (Algorithm X; or dancing links), so the performance suffers accordingly.

Contains most of the functionality you would find in a typical Sudoku application -- despite the title remaining the same (a work in progress ;-)).
