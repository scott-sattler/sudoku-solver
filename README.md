# sudoku-solver

~~older project. proof of concept. got bored (neither sufficiently novel nor difficult).~~

So-called "Sudoku Solver" is a very old project I got sucked into while trying to repurpose the UI. I ended up deciding to not reuse the UI (partly due to concerns with Tkinter), rewrote/refactored virtually everything, and added many expected features along the way.

Although I do not actually play much Sudoku, I thoroughly enjoy building things!

I have not yet employed DLX (Algorithm X; or dancing links), so the performance suffers accordingly.

Contains most of the functionality you would find in a typical Sudoku application -- despite the title remaining the same (a work in progress ;-)).
