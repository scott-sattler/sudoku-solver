todo bugs:
    hold and drag Tkinter bug; have to code workaround or ignore
    ...
    refactor solve/verify button states (enable/disable color)
    ...
    possible note CellData inclusion of note state
    ...
    0 index notes ?





    design save/load system







todo:
    rename app
    ...
    rename spawn to show/hide
    ...
    double click spawn popup???
    ...
    merge select and delete logic (shift area; old/single selection area)
    ...
    solver could use notes as an implicit stack for unexplored children...
    tho, still going to perform vastly inferior to dancing links...
    could look cool tho !
    ...
    solver was mostly to look cool, but is a bit slow on fixed 17 boards
    consider precomputing valid moves (would preserve coolness of current solution)
    ...
    ! address 40 clue min edge case
    consider adding valid transformations (for previously selected boards?)
    ...
    implement previously randomly selected record (currently in logs)
    some sort of save system... scores, etc. ?
    ...
    optimize random generation; probably require redesign using dancing links
    ...
    asyncio/multiprocessing/multithreading for board generation?
    spawn multiple threads for multiple boards? worse min, better worst case
    ...
    consider picking random cells and filling them
    ...
    review and resolve existing todos
    matrix creator via input? eg 123456789<enter>2345...
    ...
    optimization fun (temporal constraints tho :( ):
        to (more) optimally reduce density:
        transform matrix into undirected graph
        give each node
            decrement method
                decrement count of adjacent nodes (including diagonal?)
            references to diagonal neighbors (dijkstra's update analogue)
        heapify single pass array of nodes (binary heap implementation)
        using this priority queue, pop, decrement (need update?), validate

todo (old):
    taskbar icon not displaying
    consider subclasses
